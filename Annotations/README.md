Annotation Examples
===================

An example how to implement annotations in Java.

I needed to implement my own annotations, but could not find trustworthy info. So I thought to write a good example, so that other people would need less effort to write them.

I defined a NotEmpty annotation. Simple, but a good example to get you started I think.
