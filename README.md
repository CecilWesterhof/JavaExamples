JavaExamples
============

Some example how to implement things in Java.

Often you need to implement something that is simple,
but because it is new for you,
will cost you a lot of time to do.

That is why I started this git respository:
to share bits of code, to get you started.

Comments are welcome.
When you have a request: let me know. (But no guarantees.)
