JavaExamples
============

Some example how to implement things in Java.

Often you need to implement something in Java that is simple to do,
but because it is new for you,
it will cost you a lot of time to do.

That is why I started this git repository:  
to share bits of code, to get you started.

Comments are welcome.  
When you have a request:  
let me know.  
(But no guarantees.)
